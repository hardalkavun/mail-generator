# Mail Generator (Java)

This is a simple Java project that generates random email addresses.

## Features
- Random username generation (currently random bytes)
- Random selection from a large email domain list
- Displays result in the console

## Current Structure
- The username is generated using random bytes (to be improved).
- The domain is selected randomly from a predefined list of common email providers

Future Plans

    Improve username generation using letters and numbers instead of random bytes

    Refactor the code for better readability

    Add a graphical user interface (GUI) or convert the project into a simple web application

    Allow saving generated emails to a file

    Allow users to specify username length or format
