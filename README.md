# Mail Generator (Java - GUI Version)

This is an improved version of the previous **Mail Generator** project.  
Now, the project includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Java Swing.

## About
The project generates random email addresses with:
- Random username (letters and numbers)
- Randomly selected domain from a large domain list

Unlike the earlier console version, this version provides a simple graphical window where you can generate emails by clicking a button.

This version of GUI is pretty basic and not looking good it needs visual improvements
